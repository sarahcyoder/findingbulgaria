            <p>If we hadn't taken the bus from Nessebar to Sofia, I never would have seen the fields of sunflowers stretching from the valley to the mountains. We visited at the end of June/early July, which is the best time to see them. Bulgaria is one of the largest exporters of sunflower seeds and oil in the world.

			<h3>Traveling to Bulgaria</h3>
      		<p>The flight to Bulgaria will usually involve a layover, but there is a direct flight to Sofia from JKF in New York. Layovers will usually be in Paris or London, and then go on to Sofia. I recommend overnight flights and partaking in the free alcohol. The airport in Sofia is much smaller than the average American city airport and not difficult to navigate. The customs line moves pretty well and we had no problems, though I was with a native speaker, so my experience may not be the same as everyone else's.</p>
            <h3>Traveling in Bulgaria</h3>
      		<p><span class="travel">Taxi:</span> The taxi drivers in Bulgaria are daredevils. We rode in four taxis while there, and they ranged from being rather aggressive to exhibiting a  nothing-to-lose attitude. One driver passed another car on a narrow two-way city street, and his vehicle didn't contain seat belts. However, we didn't crash, and the taxis are very cheap.</p>
            <p><span class="travel">Metro:</span> The Sofia subway is great. It's modern, cheap, and convenient. If you can use it, do.</p>
            <p><span class="travel">Bus:</span> You can take a bus across the country or across town. We took a bus from Nessebar to Plovdiv, and then a few days later from Plovdiv to Sofia. The experience wasn't luxurious, but it wasn't too late or terribly uncomfortable.</p>
            <p><span class="travel">Air:</span> We flew from Sofia to Burgas on our way to Nessebar. It was a decent experience, I would say, but there were a few things I didn't like about it. We had to take a little bus from the gate to the plane. It was hot, and the little bus didn't have windows that we could open, so I was pretty claustrophobic. Once they finally let us off the bus and onto the plane, nothing was much different than a typical flight. The pilot did bank a little hard as we approached Burgas, but I suspect that was just the flight we were on, rather than a universal issue.</p>
