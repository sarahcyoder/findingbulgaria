# findingbulgaria (.com)

This repository contains code for my site FindingBuglaria.com

I built this website for a Creating Functional Websites class project for UC Davis Extension. I have since implemented Bootstrap to make it responsive after learning about that framework and wanting to try it out for myself.

In another repository on this github profile, you can see another version of FindingBulgaria.com in which I used PHP includes files to remove redundant code from each page.

Enjoy learning about Bulgaria - a great place to explore!
