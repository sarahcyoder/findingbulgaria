		<h2>RESTAURANTS</h2>

       	    Choosing a restaurant isn't easy. If you're looking for authenticity, the best restaurant probably won't be the first you see, so you may have to do some digging. <strong>But if you do, you'll be blown away. </strong></p>
      		<p>In Sofia, you can enjoy a full meal for two with drinks for less than $20 USD. In smaller cities and towns, the cost is even lower. We visited the restaurant pictured above in Plovdiv, ordered appetizers, drinks, and meals, and left without going over $15 USD.</p>
            <p>If you go in the summer, take advantage of the many restaurants with outdoor seating. You will enjoy some of the most delicious food you've ever tried. I highly recommend kebabche and kufte, minced meat patties that you can order in whatever number you wish, making them a good appetizer or entree.</p>
            <p>For a traditional meal, you should start with a salad and rakia, a traditional alcoholic drink that you will find on every menu. Bulgaria is known for the refreshing Shopska salad, which includes cucumbers, tomatoes, and cheese. Then you can order kebabche, or drop sarma, or moussaka. During my last visit, I tried dishes like lamb brain and tripe, and I was never disappointed.</p>
            <p>If you want a lighter meal, the ovcharska salata (shepherd's salad) will probably be enough, and you'll be glad you made that choice. It consists of cucumbers, tomatoes, white cheese, hard-boiled eggs, ham, and more.</p>
        <p>Tip: A little effort to speak the language goes a long way.</p>
